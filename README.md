Integrate and Transfer function in a second-order dynamic system.

The GUI in this example allows integrate a second-order dynamic system, or shows the corresponding transfer function's response.

If the user click on "Integration of the 2nd ODE" a new window is open and the result of integration is displayed. 
In this window, click on "Get TF" button to get the transfer function corresponding. Button "Back" return to main_device

If the user click on "Tranfer function 2nd" a new window is open and shows the step response of a second-order dynamic system 
of fixed natural frequency. The GUI includes a zero-poles-gain values as well as pole-zero plot of dynamic system. 

In both, set the initial values of dynamic system of second order to create the system model.

Keywords: Control System, MatLab Transfer function, pzmap, step, ramp, impulse and sinusoidal response.
